## Project Description

Project name: **SCRTsibyl_phase2**

SCRTSybil is an oracle for credit score checks developed through an initial Secret Network grant. This is an application to fund a `phase 2` expansion of SCRTsibyl through a second grant.

The SCRTsibyl dApp targets a specific use case: P2P micro-lending, namely facilitating lending and borrowing of microloans ranging between USD 1-25K. As such, the dApp is already able to compute credit scores, to validate users' credibility, and to determine the loan size (in USD) a user qualifies for.

The oracle runs a credit score check on either the user's preferred bank account (integrating through Plaid API) or the user's Coinbase account (integrating through Coinbase API). The credit check assesses the user's financial health and predicts whether the user can pay back their micro-loan. The dApp then executes a smart contract to write and store their score to the Secret Network blockchain.

Throughout the process, users are in control of their own data, which is securely stored on-chain through the privacy-preserving Secret Network protocols. When users store their score on the chain, there are gas fees involved. In order to query their score they can do so one of two ways: `(1)` They create a query permit which would be generated off chain and therefore be costless; OR `(2)` they generate a permission key, which would be stored on chain and would cost gas fees. They can issue viewing keys or the permit queries to third party providers allowing them to query the user's score without any gas fees. If the user would like to revoke their permit queries or change their viewing key, they can do so by running a state-changing function in the smart contract at the cost of a gas fee.

In `phase 2`, we want to both expand our use case including loans of +25K USD, but also increase user adoption by integrating with new data validators and allowing the u ser to self-select the loan currency. In this way, SCRTsibyl will cater to a wide loan range becoming an accessible dApp for an increasingly large pool of crypto investors.

## Problem / Solution

A credit score is a number that expresses your credit information at one point in time. It indicates the risk you represent for lenders, compared with other consumers, on a scale from 300 to 900. High scores on this scale are good. The higher your score, the lower the risk for the lender.

We believe in the value of having a public network with the option and flexibility of data encryption and ultimately believe that mainstream tools for financial services like credit scores will be among the first major requirements for service providers on Secret Network and in the web3 environment.

How can one validate a user's financial pedigree while preserving their privacy? SCRTsibyl allows both. We aim to bring together lenders and borrowers through a dApp designed around the principles of security, data validation, encryption, and data privacy.

## Detailed Product Description :bulb: :high_brightness: :toolbox:

`Phase 2` of SCRTsibyl features the following extensions:

- **Expand validator options**: we will integrate with the Binance API. Binance is a well-established and growing crypto exchange platform. We want to allow those users who don't own a Coinbase wallet to connect their Binance account instead. Thus, users have now the choice to connect either their Coinbase account, their Binance account, or their traditional bank account. Please find a preview of the [validators](./images/validators.png).

- **Add credit score history**: a user's score may change and improve over time and we want to empower users with a positive pedigree to demonstrate their credit history improvement. We'll implement a query function to fetch the chronologically ordered list of their credit scores with associated timestamps. Users will be in control of their credit score history and, if they so choose, they can share it with third parties. Please find previews of the [history chart](./images/history_chart.png) and the [history table](./images/history_table.png).

- **Allow smart currency selection**: the user interacts with the SCRTSibyl UI to custom-choose their preferred currency (fiat or crypto) for score calculation. The dApp will automatically standardize all the metrics in the credit scoring algorithm to the chosen currency. The range of currencies will be initially limited to a predetermined set (USD, EUR, BTC, ETX, USDT, USDC, BNB, XRP). We will integrate with an API (likely [CoinAPI.io](https://github.com/coinapi/coinapi-sdk)) to perform real-time currency conversion.

- **Improve risk indicators**: we will increase the output accuracy of the credit scoring model by returning `low` / `medium` / `high-risk` indicators on the scoring bin assigned to the user. For example, imagine a user qualified for a mini-loan ranging from USD 5-10K. This scoring bin is rather broad, and a user may be very well suited to receive a loan of USD 6K but may struggle to pay back a loan worth USD 9K. Thus, we'll develop three categories to assess the risk level for given users to receive their associated loans. The same user qualifying for USD 5-10K may be a low-risk user in receiving a USD 6K loan, yet a high-risk user for a USD 9K loan. Please find a preview of the [risk indicator](./images/risk_indicator.png).

- **DApp Adoption KPIs**: we will track user adoption for SCRTsibyl. Since the DApp leverages a smart contract to write a score to the blockchain, the DApp leaves a virtual paper trail of all on-chain transactions associated with score calculation. For instance, each transaction sent to the contract originates from a particular Secret Network address. Counting the number of unique Secret Network addresses that submit transactions to the contract (i.e. if a particular address sends five transactions in a day, count them once) will provide a good estimate of the number of users interacting with the DApp. We commit to providing at least 2 KPI indicators. A sample list of adoption KPI indicators follows.

| Indicator | Description        | Measure                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TU        | Total Users        | Total number of users that have interacted with the DApp since completion of Phase2.              |
| NU        | New Users          | Number of users storing their credit score to chain for the first time over a selected timeframe. |
| DAU       | Daily Active Users | Number of unique Secret Network addresses that submit transactions to the contract.               |
| UA        | User Adherence     | Number of returning users calculating their credit score repeatedly over time.                    |
| ...       | ...                |                                                                                                   |

## Value Capture for Secret Network Ecosystem

As part of the strategy to gain traffic in the Secret Network, we are expanding the access channels to SCRT Sybil credit scoring tool, improving the user experience, and increasing the loan range eligibility. The go-to-market plan plan consists of:

1. User adoption: integrating with Binance will onboard more users since it holds more than 600 cryptocurrencies and it is one of the most popular and largest cryptocurrency exchanges.

2. User experience: tracking credit history and selecting different loan currencies will enhance the whole experience by providing more control to user's own decisions.

3. User loan range: refining the accuracy of the credit score will allow the initial P2P micro-lending loans to increase to up to USD 100,000.

As we expand to more users and improve model accuracy, we strengthen the credibility and robustness of the oracle.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: :dart: :pushpin:

### Why SCRT?

1. **How did you hear about the Secret Network grants?** We have been collaborating with the SCRT Labs Team for the last 4 months and we are just about to complete and release the very first Credit Score Oracle we developed for the Secret Network.

2. **Have you ever applied for other grants?** Yes, this is a follow-up grant to expand the work we completed after the first SCRT grant we received in January 2022.

### Future Plans

1. **Subscription**

   Develop a membership plan to allow users to have their credit scores updated every month so they can even more demonstrate their credibility.

2. **Blacklisting**

   Develop a feature to red flag or blacklist late payers and bad payers to avoid distrusted users or potential defaults.

3. **Machine Learning**

   Develop Machine Learning models alongside the credit scores so that users do not need to trust a single specific entity fully.
